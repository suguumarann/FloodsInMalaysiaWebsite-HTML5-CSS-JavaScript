                <h3>There are a number of factors responsible for causing the deadly flash floods in Malaysia</h3>
                <h3>which are heavy rainfall, deforestation, climate change, and also clogged drains.</h3>

                <h3 class="sub_header em shadow">(1) Heavy Rainfall</h3><br><br>
                <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Malaysia experiences heavy rainfall every year, with the average being recorded between 2000-2500mm. These rain showers become even heavier during the monsoon seasons which usually occur between April-September (Southwest) and October-March (Northeast). The increased rainfall is usually too much for the rivers and existing drainage systems to hold (causing them to burst their banks and overflow) or the ground to absorb (resulting in the rainwater becoming surface run-off).</div>

                    <img class="img2" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/459451/pexels-photo-459451.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600">

                <br>
                <h3 class="sub_header em shadow">(2) Deforestation</h3><br><br>
                <div style = "text-align: justify;">Malaysia was once covered in trees but has been losing its forests at an alarming rate over the years. Google’s global forest map revealed that Malaysia had the world’s highest deforestation rate at 14.4% between 2000-2012. Though the rates had fallen in recent years, the loss in forest cover still contributes to the worsening floods, according to analysts. Though deforestation can not be pinned down as the primary culprit behind every recent flood, it is known that forests can serve as a buffer to heavy rainfall; a tropical rainforest can intercept about 30% of rainfall in its canopy, with the remaining percentage being absorbed into the soil or taken up by tree roots.

                    According to Mr Damien Thanam Divean, vice-president of the non-governmental organisation Pertubuhan Pelindung Khazanah Alam Malaysia (PEKA), the clear-cutting of forests to plant crops such as palm oil and durian fruit had reduced the ability of the land to absorb water, worsening the floods.</div>

                <h3 class="sub_header em shadow">(3) Climate Change</h3><br><br>

                <div style = "text-align: justify;">Regarded as the primary suspect for the heavier rainfalls in recent years, it is feared that a warming climate may lead to longer and more unpredictable monsoon seasons, resulting in more ‘surprise’ flash floods caused by stronger and longer-lasting rainstorms. A study conducted by C40 Cities predicts that if we fail to reverse the current climate trends, Malaysia will be at an even greater risk of devastating floods by 2050.</div>

                <h3 class="sub_header em shadow">(4) Clogged Drains</h3><br><br>

                <div style = "text-align: justify;">The SMART tunnel was constructed for the purpose of diverting flood water from the Klang River into the Batu and Jinjang retention ponds in Air Panas and Setapak Jaya. However, the tunnel can only perform its duty as long as the city’s drainage and irrigation channels are open and free of blockage. And unfortunately, we Malaysians have a tendency to simply throw our rubbish anywhere we want, and that includes our drains and rivers. Clogged with garbage that disrupts the flow of water, our city drains and the rivers that flow through KL will inevitably overfill and spill out their contents.</div>
